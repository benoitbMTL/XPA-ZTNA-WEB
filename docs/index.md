# Welcome to the Xperts ZTNA Track

## Introduction
Welcome to the Fortinet Xperts Workshop, the ultimate adventure in the Fortinet Universe! ðŸš€

You are about to explore the Fortinet Security Fabric, a powerful and integrated platform that delivers unmatched protection and visibility across the entire digital attack surface. You will discover how to use the Fortinet Zero Trust Network Access solution, which enables secure access to applications and data from any device, location, or network.

Your mission is to collect all the tags across the Fortinet Security Fabric, which represent different aspects of the user and admin experience. Each tag will reveal a new level of knowledge and insight into how Fortinet solutions work together to provide end-to-end security.

You will also get to experience the amazing features of the following components of the hands-on lab:

- FortiClient, which provides endpoint security and Zero Trust Network Access agent.
- FortiNAC, which provides network access control, visibility, and incident response.
- FortiOS, which is the operating system that powers the FortiGate firewall and acts as a ZTNA Proxy.
- FortiPAM, which provides privileged access management and session recording.
- FortiTrust Identity, which provides identity verification and multi-factor authentication.

Are you ready to take on this challenge? Then strap in and get ready for a thrilling ride through the Fortinet Universe! ðŸŒŸ

We hope you enjoy this hands-on lab and have fun learning with us. Thank you for choosing Fortinet as your trusted partner in cybersecurity. ðŸ˜Š
